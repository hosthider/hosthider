Hi, Iâ€™m @hosthider

I really like automation but I'm learning how to code now for the first time. Current language is C and am using Sam's Teach Yourself book. So far 9/10.

Going to be uploading the programs we're covering my "assigments" covered in the book. Then moving on to more projects afterwards. 

I need to start being serious about Github and programming as a whole so this is my attempt at starting in the world of Electrical and Computer Engineering. 

Currently in school for the 2nd time, long story, as an Electrical Engineer.
